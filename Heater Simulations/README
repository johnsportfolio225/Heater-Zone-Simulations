For Zone1_MATLAB.mlx, please download the file and open it in MATLAB.

After opening the file, press the Run command.

Since this is a live script, plots will auto-populate in the output window.

These can be scrolled through interactively as the script executes, or you can step through sections one at a time using Run Section.

At the end of execution, you will have a complete set of response plots showing the simulated heater zone behavior.

Results can be exported directly from the figures (e.g., save as PNG, PDF, or MATLAB figure file).
